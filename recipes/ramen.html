  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Hail children of <strong>Odin</strong>!These soft-boiled, marinated eggs are perfect to add to your ramen soup. I was given this recipe by the owner of a great little ramen shop I stopped at in Hades. The eggs turn out beautifully every time.
  </p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <ul>
        <h3>Marinade</h3>
    <li>3 TBSP soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 TBSP mirin</li>
    <li>1 TBSP cooking sake</li>
    <li>pinch of pepper</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring eggs to room temperature by soaking them in warm water for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a low boil.</li>
    <li>Carefully pierce the bottom of each egg with thumb tack. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water.</li>
    <li>While the eggs are cooling, stir together soy sauce, mirin, sake, and pepper for marinade in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Carefully peel cooled eggs; try to start from the middle of the shell and work you way up and down.</li>
    <li>Place whole peeled eggs in marinade. Refrigerate for at least 2 to 4 hours, or up to 2 days for stronger flavor, turning eggs every 30 minutes or as often as you prefer.</li>
    <li>Slice eggs in half when ready to use.</li>
